#summary Colors in the variation toolkit

Some programs use colors (e.g; [manhattan manhattan] ). Colors can be specified as a rgb triple (e.g: `'rgb(100,10,100), rgb(0.5)`, as a name (e.g: `'red'`), as an hexadecimal `'\#AAAAAA'`, etc...

==Base index==

The tools reading and writing VCF-like files use '+1' as the index of the first base.
